# LAB331: Use Azure SQL DB and REST endpoints to enable AI content moderation

Learn how to invoke external REST endpoints from other Azure services without having to write complex code or functions. This hands-on lab will walk you through setting up AI-assisted content moderation using Azure SQL Database and REST endpoints. By the end of this lab, you will understand of how to use stored procedures to make REST calls to Azure AI Content Safety, Azure OpenAI, and Azure AI Language and how to extend this approach to other AI scenarios, such as language processing and generative AI.
