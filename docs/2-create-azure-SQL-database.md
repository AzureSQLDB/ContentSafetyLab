# Deploy the database objects to the Azure SQL Database

The next section of the workshop will be using an Azure SQL Database. To move our development environment into the cloud, all that is needed to be done is use SQL Database Projects and point it at an Azure SQL Database. The deploy feature will then create the objects in the selected cloud database just as it did with the local SQL Server database in the code space.

## Deploy to Azure workshop tasks

### Create a free Azure SQL Database

1. Ensure you have an Azure account to log into the Azure Portal. Need a free account? Sign up for one [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free).

    * Use the name of the server you created in the previous section as the server name, then press Enter.
        ![A picture of using the free sql db server name as the server name](./media/ch2/deploy3.png)

    * Use the name of the database you created for the free Azure SQL Database as the database name, then press Enter.
        ![A picture of using the free database as the database name](./media/ch2/deploy4.png)

    * In the Authentication Type dialog box, select “SQL Login“.

### Verify the deployed database objects and data

1. While still on the **SQL Server Connections extension**, right click the database profile name,**Free Azure Database**, and select **New Query**. This will bring up a new query sheet.

    ![A picture of right clicking the Free Azure Database profile name and selecting New Query](./media/ch2/deploy25.png)

1. Run the following code in the query sheet:

    ```SQL
    select * from dbo.person;

    select p.person_name, a.address
    from dbo.person p inner join dbo.[address] a
    on p.person_id = a.person_id;
    
    select * from dbo.todo;
    go
    ```

1. You can also test out the stored procedure with the following code:

    ```SQL
    exec get_person_by_pet 'Dogs';
    ```

### Azure SQL migration extension for Azure Data Studio

The Azure SQL migration extension for Azure Data Studio enables you to assess, get right-sized Azure recommendations and migrate your SQL Server databases to Azure. You can use the Azure SQL Migration extension to assess SQL Server databases running on Windows or Linux.

The Azure SQL Migration extension for Azure Data Studio offers these key benefits:

* A responsive UI for an end-to-end migration experience. The extension starts with a migration readiness assessment and SKU recommendation (preview) (based on performance data).
* An enhanced assessment mechanism that can evaluate SQL Server instances. The extension identifies databases that are ready to migrate to Azure SQL targets.
* An SKU recommendation engine that collects performance data from the on-premises source SQL Server instance and then generates right-sized SKU recommendations based on your Azure SQL target.
* A reliable Azure service powered by Azure Database Migration Service that orchestrates data movement activities to deliver a seamless migration experience.
* You can run your migration online (for migrations that require minimal downtime) or offline (for migrations where downtime persists throughout the migration) depending on your business requirements.
* You can configure a self-hosted integration runtime to use your own compute resources to access the source SQL Server instance backup files in your on-premises environment.
* Provides a secure and improved user experience for migrating TDE databases and SQL/Windows logins to Azure SQL.
